    <h3>What is SH1MMER?</h3>
    <p>
      SH1MMER is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="https://mercurywork.shop/">Mercury Workshop team</a> and
      was released on January,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.friday)">Friday the 13th</u>, 2023.

      For more info, check out the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a>
    </p>
    <h4>
      If this isn't working for you, check
      <button id="fogbutton" style="cursor: pointer">"The Fog"</button>
      section below.
    </h4>

  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <li>A USB with at least 8 GBs of storage</li>
    <li>
      <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A personal computer or chromebook;</u> note that you
      need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
    </li>
    <hr>
    <h3>Writing to USB</h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This can
      be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook and
      copying the word after <kbd>stable-channel</kbd>, or with
      <u onclick="alert(messages.board)">a variety of other methods</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to
      source it
      on your own... somehow.
    </p>
    brask, brya, clapper, coral, corsola, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt, 
    hana, hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks, sentry, 
    stout, strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
    <p>
      First you need to download a SH1MMER bin. Download a shim at <a href="https://dl.sh1mmer.me/">dl.sh1mmer.me</a><br> , and build it with the <a href="https://sh1mmer.me/builder" target="_self">SH1MMER web builder</a><br>
      Once you've obtained a MODIFIED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download the
      <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm">
        Chromebook Recovery Utility extension
      </a>
      <spc></spc>
      on your personal computer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the downloads are complete,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.launch)">launch the recovery utility</u>
      and plug your USB into your personal computer.
    </p>
    <i>Note: Your USB will be completely cleared and partitioned.</i>
    <p>
      In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon and press "Use
      local image".
    </p>
    <p>
      Select your shim file, identify your USB, and start the writing process.
      This will take about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button (‚èª), reload key (‚Üª), and ESC key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>

    <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is off". You will most likely not actually be in dev mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>

    <p>
      On this screen, press the power button (‚èª), reload key (‚Üª), and ESC key at
      the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB
      into your Chromebook, and press the power button (‚èª), reload key (‚Üª), and
      ESC key again. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you should
      be in the SH1MMER menu.
    </p>

    <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p>
